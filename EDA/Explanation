EDA = Exploratory Data Analysis

👉 In simple words:
EDA means looking at data carefully to understand what is inside before doing machine learning or analysis.

📌 What is EDA?
Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main features, mostly using graphs and statistics.
It helps to:
1.Understand data structure
2.Find patterns
3.Detect errors
4.Find relationships between columns
EDA is usually done before building models.

🧠 Why EDA is Used (Main Reasons)
1️⃣ Understand Data Before Using It
EDA helps analysts look at data before making assumptions.
Example:
1.How many columns?
2.What data types?
3.Is data balanced?

2️⃣ Find Patterns and Trends
EDA helps discover hidden patterns and relationships.
Example:
1.Sales increases in festival season
2.High salary → more spending

3️⃣ Detect Errors and Missing Data
EDA helps find:
-->Missing values
-->Wrong data
-->Duplicate data
-->Outliers
This improves data quality.

4️⃣ Helps Choose Correct ML Model
EDA helps decide:
1.Which features to use
2.Which model works best
3.Which data cleaning needed

📌 What EDA is Mainly Used For
✔ Data Science
✔ Machine Learning
✔ Business Analysis
✔ Data Engineering (Data checking stage)

📌 What We Do in EDA (Main Tasks)
1. Data Cleaning
🔹Remove duplicates
🔹Fill missing values
🔹Fix wrong data

2.🔹 Data Statistics
Check:
Mean
Median
Standard deviation
Distribution

3. Data Visualization
Common graphs:
Histogram
Bar chart
Scatter plot
Heatmap

🔹 Relationship Checking
Check correlation between columns
