🧠 ML Problem: Customer Churn
📌 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to build a Machine Learning application that predicts whether a customer will churn (leave service) 
or stay, based on customer details such as tenure, monthly charges, contract type, and internet service.

Features:
● Tenure
● Monthly charges
● Contract type
● Internet service

📄 app.py
👉 Main Streamlit app router.

What it does:
Controls navigation between pages
Loads session state
Connects training and prediction pages

📄 requirements.txt
👉 Contains all required Python libraries.
Example:
streamlit
pandas
scikit-learn
This helps others install dependencies easily.

📁 data/
📄 churn.csv
👉 Dataset used to train ML model.

Contains:
tenure → Customer months with company
monthly_charges → Monthly bill amount
contract → Contract type
internet_service → Internet type
churn → Target (Yes / No)

🧪 Machine Learning Layer
📁 ml/
📄 preprocess.py

👉 Handles data preprocessing before training.
What we do here:

✔ Separate features (X) and target (y)
✔ Convert churn Yes/No → 1/0
✔ Identify categorical columns
✔ Apply One Hot Encoding
✔ Combine numeric + encoded categorical data

Why?
ML models cannot understand text → So we convert categories to numbers.

📄 model.py
👉 Contains model training logic.

What we do:
✔ Train Logistic Regression model
✔ Use @st.cache_resource

Why cache_resource?
Avoid retraining model every time app reloads
Improves performance
Keeps model shared across sessions

🖥 Application Pages
📁 pages/
📄 train.py

👉 Model training UI page.
What happens here:

✔ Load dataset
✔ Display dataset in UI
✔ Train model when button clicked
✔ Store model + encoder in session state

Why session state?
So model stays available for prediction without retraining.

📄 predict.py
👉 Customer churn prediction page.

What happens here:
✔ User enters customer details
✔ Uses trained model from session
✔ Applies encoder transformation
✔ Predicts churn probability
✔ Displays risk level

Output:
Churn probability %
High risk or Low risk message
🧠 Session Management
📁 state/
📄 session.py

👉 Initializes Streamlit session state.

What we do:
Check if model exists in session
If not → initialize as None

Why?
Prevent errors
Maintain model between page refreshes

🎨 UI Utilities
📁 utils/
📄 ui.py

👉 Contains reusable UI helper functions.
Example:

Layout styling
Custom components
Reusable UI blocks

🔄 Application Flow
Step 1 → Load Dataset
Step 2 → Preprocess Data
Step 3 → Train ML Model
Step 4 → Store Model in Session
Step 5 → User Inputs Customer Details
Step 6 → Model Predicts Churn Probability
Step 7 → Show Result in UI
🤖 ML Model Used
Logistic Regression
Why Used?

✔ Simple and fast
✔ Works well for binary classification
✔ Easy to explain results

🧾 Summary
This project is a production-style ML Streamlit application that demonstrates the full pipeline 
from data preprocessing → model training → prediction → deployment-ready UI.
